#Xlib 
Xlib Module used to determine initial state of Caps and Num lock status.

**#** **Note:** I have to mention one thing that am very very new to PyQt and Python itself. I have started learning python merely 10 days before so this code is not efficient one, can be modified to very few lines. Am sharing this project because it may help some of the begginers like me to learn about python.
